 Interactive Form project

 This project focused on many of the aspects of adding functionality to web forms by using jQuery methods to enhance the supplied HTML. Students were also asked to use unobtrusive JavaScript and progressive enhancement to ensure that the critical form elements could be accessed across browsers and in instances where JavaScript was disabled or otherwise not able to run.

A major component of this project involved the implementatiion of form validation, which includes use of loops, conditional commands, and event handlers to determine whether validation criteria is met.

Some other tasks for this project included use of various jQuery methods to add elements and traverse the DOM as well as showing/hiding form elements based on user selection from a chechbox or menu. This also included real time cost totaling when user makes a selection from Activities list and functionality to allow user to only select activities that do not conflict with eachother.

Some additional programming I chose to include for extra credit:
-Hiding the color label and select menu until user selection is made
-Generating conditional form validation error messages based on whether the input is too short/long (credit card), with additional error message if field left blank
-Real time error message displayed as user begins to type in email text field (rather than only validating on form submit)
